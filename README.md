  Calvin University, located at the heart of Michigan, has students and staff coming from all over the world. However, most of these students cannot take the full advantage of the travelling experience due to the lack of information, transportation method, or even companions with whom to enjoy the trip. Our solution to this is CalTrip, a travel application that posts monthly events or trips that are popular within the area that Calvin students and staff can enjoy. CalTrip’s goal is to bring together those who are new to Michigan so that they can enjoy activities while making new friends. Users will be able to access information from a “bulletin board” type forum that not only displays popular activities happening within the Grand Rapids area but also displays posts created by users. Each post will consist of information about the activity and may include ride requests and signups.

Compared to other trip apps like TripAdvisor, Caltrip not only lists interesting destinations but also allows users to connect with other Calvin students who can provide or request any needs the planned trip requires(i.e. transportation). As our target market is Calvin University, the users will be able to sign up and log in with their Calvin email address.
