## Vision Statement

Michigan might not appear as a dream travel destination but in reality, it provides multiple places to visit and activities to enjoy. Calvin University, located at the heart of Michigan, has students and staff coming from all over the world. However, most of these students cannot take the full advantage of the travelling experience due to a lack of information, transportation method, or even a companion to enjoy the trip with. Our solution to this is CalTrip: CalTrip is a travel application that posts monthly events or trips that are popular within the area that Calvin people can enjoy. However, unlike other travel apps like TripAdvisor, CalTrip allows users to connect with different companions who can provide or request any needs the planned trip or event requires (i.e. transportation). Having said this, even those who are new to Michigan can enjoy the activities while making new friends.

CalTrip is a mobile application to provide information about general activities happening within the Grand Rapids area that allows for users to access said information and post activities that require a certain number of students. The features would consist of a “bulletin board” type forum that displays certain activities posted by users with information about the activities, inclusive of an image, a short description, the contact information, location and price. Sign ups can be required, and ride requests would be an optional feature. As our target market is Calvin University, the users must sign up and log in with their Calvin email address.
